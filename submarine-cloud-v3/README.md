# submarine-cloud-v3 (submarine operator)

`submarine-cloud-v3`, i.e. **submarine-operator**, implements the operator for Submarine application. The operator provides a new option for users to deploy the Submarine service to their Kubernetes clusters. The **submarine-operator** can fix some errors automatically. However, if the Submarine service is deployed with Helm, the errors need to be fixed by human operators.

# Development

Please check out the [Developer Guide](./docs/developer-guide.md).
