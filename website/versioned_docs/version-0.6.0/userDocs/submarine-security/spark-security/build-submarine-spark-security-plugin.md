Submarine Spark Security Plugin is built using [Apache Maven](http://maven.apache.org). To build it, `cd` to the root direct of submarine project and run:

```bash
mvn clean package -Dmaven.javadoc.skip=true -DskipTests -pl :submarine-spark-security
```

By default, Submarine Spark Security Plugin is built against Apache Spark `2.3.x` and Apache Ranger `1.1.0`, which may be incompatible with other Apache Spark or Apache Ranger releases.

Currently, available profiles are:

**Spark**: `-Pspark-2.3`, `-Pspark-2.4`, `-Pspark-3.0`

**Ranger**: `-Pranger-1.2`, `-Pranger-2.0`
