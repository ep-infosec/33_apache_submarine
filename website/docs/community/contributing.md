There are several ways to contribute to Submarine:
1. Develop and Commit source code (This document will primarily focus on this.)
2. Report issues (You can report issues with both Github or Jira.)
3. Discuss/Answer questions on the mailing list
4. Share use cases

## Preface
* **Apache Submarine** is an [Apache 2.0 License](https://github.com/apache/submarine/blob/master/LICENSE) Software. Contributing to Submarine means you agree to the Apache 2.0 License. 
* Please read [Code of Conduct](http://www.apache.org/foundation/policies/conduct.html) carefully.
* The document [How It Works](http://www.apache.org/foundation/how-it-works.html) can help you understand Apache Software Foundation further.

## Build Submarine
* [Build From Code](../devDocs/BuildFromCode.md)

## Creating patches
Submarine follows [Fork & Pull](https://github.com/sevntu-checkstyle/sevntu.checkstyle/wiki/Development-workflow-with-Git:-Fork,-Branching,-Commits,-and-Pull-Request) model.

### Step1: Fork apache/submarine github repository (first time)
* Visit https://github.com/apache/submarine
* Click the `Fork` button to create a fork of the repository

### Step2: Clone the Submarine to your local machine 
```sh
# USERNAME â€“ your Github user account name.
git clone git@github.com:${USERNAME}/submarine.git
# or: git clone https://github.com/${USERNAME}/submarine.git 
 
cd submarine
# set upstream 
git remote add upstream git@github.com:apache/submarine.git
# or: git remote add upstream https://github.com/apache/submarine.git

# Don't push to the upstream master.
git remote set-url --push upstream no_push

# Check upstream/origin:
# origin    git@github.com:${USERNAME}/submarine.git (fetch)
# origin    git@github.com:${USERNAME}/submarine.git (push)
# upstream  git@github.com:apache/submarine.git (fetch)
# upstream  no_push (push)
git remote -v
```

### Step3: Create a new Jira in Submarine project
* New contributors need privilege to create JIRA issues. Please email kaihsun@apache.org with your Jira username. In addition, the email title should be "[New Submarine Contributor]".
* Check [Jira issue tracker](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/SUBMARINE/issues/SUBMARINE-748?filter=allopenissues) for existing issues.
* Create a new Jira issue in Submarine project. When the issue is created, a Jira number (eg. SUBMARINE-748) will be assigned to the issue automatically.

### Step4: Create a local branch for your contribution
```sh
cd submarine

# Make your local master up-to-date
git checkout master
git fetch upstream 
git rebase upstream/master

# Create a new branch fro issue SUBMARINE-${jira_number}
git checkout -b SUBMARINE-${jira_number}

# Example: git checkout -b SUBMARINE-748 
```

### Step5: Develop & Create commits
* You can edit the code on the `SUBMARINE-${jira_number}` branch. (Coding Style: [Code Convention](#code-convention))
* Create commits
```sh
git add ${edited files}
git commit -m "SUBMARINE-${jira_number}. ${Commit Message}"
# Example: git commit -m "SUBMARINE-748. Update Contributing guide" 
```

### Step6: Syncing your local branch with upstream/master 
```sh
# On SUBMARINE-${jira_number} branch
git fetch upstream
git rebase upstream/master
```

* Please do not use `git pull` to synchronize your local branch. Because `git pull` does a merge to create merged commits, these will make commit history messy.

### Step7: Push your local branch to your personal fork
```sh
git push origin SUBMARINE-${jira_number} 
```

### Step8: Check GitHub Actions status of your personal commit
* Visit `https://github.com/${USERNAME}/submarine/actions`
* Please make sure your new commits can pass all workflows before creating a pull request.

### Step9: Create a pull request on github UI
* Visit your fork at `https://github.com/${USERNAME}/submarine.git`
* Click `Compare & Pull Request` button to create pull request.
![compare_pull_request_button](/img/compare_pull_request_button.png)

#### Pull Request template
* [Pull request template](https://github.com/apache/submarine/blob/bd7578cc28f8280f9170938d4469fcc965e24a89/.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE)
* Filling the template thoroughly can improve the speed of the review process. Example: 

![pull_request_template_example](/img/pull_request_template_example.png)

### Step10: Check GitHub Actions status of your pull request in apache/submarine
* Visit https://github.com/apache/submarine/actions
* Please make sure your pull request can pass all workflows. 

### Step11: The Review Process
* Anyone can be a reviewer and comment on the pull requests.
* Reviewer can indicate that a patch looks suitable for merging with a comment such as: "Looks good", "LGTM", "+1". (PS: LGTM = Looks Good To Me)
* At least one indication of suitability (e.g. "LGTM") from a committer is required to be merged. 
* A committer can then initiate lazy consensus ("Merge if there is no more discussion") after which the code can be merged after a particular time (usually 24 hours) if there are no more reviews.
* Contributors can ping reviewers (including committers) by commenting 'Ready to review'.

### Step12: Address review comments 
* Push new commits to SUBMARINE-${jira_number} branch. The pull request will update automatically.
* After you address all review comments, committers will merge the pull request.


### Code convention
We are following Google Code style:

* [Java style](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html)
* [Shell style](https://google.github.io/styleguide/shell.xml)

There are some plugins to format, lint your code in IDE (use [dev-support/maven-config/checkstyle.xml](hhttps://github.com/apache/submarine/blob/master/dev-support/maven-config/checkstyle.xml) as rules)

* [Checkstyle plugin for Intellij](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/1065) ([Setting Guide](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/26955766/intellij-idea-checkstyle))
* [Checkstyle plugin for Eclipse](http://eclipse-cs.sourceforge.net/#!/) ([Setting Guide](http://eclipse-cs.sourceforge.net/#!/project-setup))
