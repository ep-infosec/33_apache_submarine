Submarine Python SDK can runs on any machine and it will talk to Submarine Server via REST API. So you can install Submarine Python SDK on your laptop, a gateway machine, your favorite IDE (like PyCharm/Jupyter, etc.).

Furthermore, Submarine supports an extensible package of CTR models based on **TensorFlow** and **PyTorch** along with lots of core components layers that can be used to easily build custom models. You can train any model with `model.train()` and `model.predict()`.

## Prepare Python Environment to run Submarine SDK

Submarine SDK requires Python3.7+.
It's better to use a new Python environment created by `Anoconda` or Python `virtualenv` to try this to avoid trouble to existing Python environment.
A sample Python virtual env can be setup like this:

```bash
wget https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/33/bc/fa0b5347139cd9564f0d44ebd2b147ac97c36b2403943dbee8a25fd74012/virtualenv-16.0.0.tar.gz
tar xf virtualenv-16.0.0.tar.gz

# Make sure to install using Python 3
python3 virtualenv-16.0.0/virtualenv.py venv
. venv/bin/activate
```

## Install Submarine SDK

### Install SDK from pypi.org (recommended)

Starting from `0.4.0`, Submarine provides Python SDK. Please change it to a proper version needed. 

More detail: https://pypi.org/project/apache-submarine/

```bash
# Install latest stable version
pip install apache-submarine
# Install specific version
pip install apache-submarine==<REPLACE_VERSION>
```

### Install SDK from source code

Please first clone code from github or go to `http://submarine.apache.org/download.html` to download released source code.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/apache/submarine.git
# (optional) chackout specific branch or release
git checkout <correct release tag/branch>
cd submarine/submarine-sdk/pysubmarine
pip install .
```

## Manage Submarine Experiment

Assuming you've installed submarine on K8s and forward the traefik service to localhost, now you can open a Python shell, Jupyter notebook or any tools with Submarine SDK installed.

Follow [SDK experiment example](https://github.com/apache/submarine/blob/master/submarine-sdk/pysubmarine/example/submarine_experiment_sdk.ipynb) to run an experiment.

## Training a DeepFM model 
The Submarine also supports users to train an easy-to-use CTR model with a few lines of code and a configuration file, so they donâ€™t need to reimplement the model by themself. In addition, they can train the model on both local on distributed systems, such as Hadoop or Kubernetes.


Follow [SDK DeepFM example](https://github.com/apache/submarine/blob/master/submarine-sdk/pysubmarine/example/deepfm_example.ipynb) to try the model.
