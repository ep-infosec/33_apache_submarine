# Submarine Web

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.3.9.

## Development server

> Start the Submarine server first

Run `npm start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Package

Run `mvn clean package` to package the project. The build `workbech-web-ng.war` will be stored in the `target` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).

## Adding end-to-end test cases

If you want to add end-to-end test cases, please click [here](./e2e/README.md) for reference.

## Formatting the code
There are two ways to format the code.

1. Install node/npm **globally** to enable husky. If you commit the code, it will trigger pre-commit hook and auto-format your code.
2. If you do not install node/npm globally, it will not trigger pre-commit hook. However, you can run `npm autoformat` to format your code manually.
